## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this assignment, I learned what version control systems are and why they are important. VCS save and backup files from a local directory and allow you to restore previous versions if needed. 
2. There are three type of VCS: local, centralized and distributed. Local VCS copy files from your computer to a directory. Centralized VCS store all the files in one centralized server. Distributed VCS allow clients to mirror a repository.
3. There are three states files in a repository can be in: modified, staged, and committed. A modified file is a file that has been changed, but not saved. In order to save a file, you must stage it first; which is when a modified file in its current version is marked to be committed. A committed file has been successfully saved and stored in the local database.
